# Scrapping Paginated Pages

Selecting the best UX pattern for your site 

To display a subset of a larger list, you can choose between different UX patterns:

**Pagination: Where a user can use links such as "next", "previous", and page numbers to navigate between pages that display one page of results at a time.**

Load more: Buttons that a user can click to extend an initial set of displayed results.

Infinite scroll: Where a user can scroll to the end of the page to cause more content to be loaded. (Learn more about infinite scroll search-friendly recommendations.)
