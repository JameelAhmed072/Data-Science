Exploring Hacker News Posts
In this project we're specifically interested in posts whose titles begin with either Ask HN or Show HN. 

* Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question.
* Users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting. 

We will analyze which type of post and time receive the most comments on average i.e we need to advise on best hour to maximize the amount of comments a post receives

Our aim is to compare these two types of posts to determine the following:

1. Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
2. Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?



# Task 01: 

> Most Number Of Comments On Avg (Ask or Show ?)




# Task 02: 

> Now we will find average comments again but now we will do it wrt hours.

> Target is to know when to ask something on website (so we can get good response).

> By knowing the time we can engage more people and target more human traffic
